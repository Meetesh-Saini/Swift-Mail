    body: `Greetings from TCS!!

    Hope you and your loved ones are doing well.
    
    As part of TCS CodeVita Season 11, the registrations are closed and we have received a good number of registrations from your college!
        
    The instructions for the students will be communicated directly going forward for the participation. We would like you to also know the process the candidates are taking for better clarity.
    
    Points to note:
    
    Kindly ask the students to read the instructions very clearly as it is very important. FAQs are also in it which will help the students get a proper understanding of the process.
    If the students have more doubts on the process, that is not part of the instructions manual, only then can they mail us (using the template attached).
    All this information has already been communicated to the students but like already mentioned, 
    Make sure all the students do not login at the same time as it will end up in bandwidth issue. The contest is open for 24 hours, so plan the login time of the students in batches and slots and make them login at that time.
    We request the college to take complete ownership of the process by monitoring and guiding the students throughout the contest. Please plan the bandwidth accordingly and enable to students login.
    We hope for 100% participation and completion of the contest. Please ensure the contest is completed successfully by all the registered students and not left midway by them.
    College wise monitoring is tracked by the Corporate team based on participation and completion/submission, so kindly make sure all your students adhere to the same.`,
